# UnityScollMenuPrefab

I recently followed a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI6DwJtjlBA) by c00pala on how to make a UI for a scrollable list of buttons. Thought it would be nice to upload the final result of his video for anyone to use. 

The Unity Package has the prefab to use along with a scene showing it in use. If you have never imported a Unity package before, I’ve included instructions to assist you.  

How to import:
1)	Create a New Unity 3D Project (I recommend using version 2019.4.5f or later since that is what I used)
2)	Download “ScrollMenuPrefabAndExampleScene.unitypackage” on to your computer
3)	In Unity press Assets > Import Package > Custom Package and select the package you downloaded in step 2
4)	A window will come up. Ensure that both the prefab and example scene are selected then press Import. 
5)	Double click on the ScrollMenuExample scene in your assets to open the project. Run it and you will see your scrollable list just like the image you see below:
